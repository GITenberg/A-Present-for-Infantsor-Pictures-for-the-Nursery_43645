<div class='unindent'><b><big>T</big>AKE</b> care, little girl, that you do not
fall into the water; for if once you fell in,
you could not get out again, unless somebody
happened to come to your assistance.
When you are sent by your mother to fetch
water, you should be careful how you dip
your jug in; and after it is filled, you
should go steadily home, without playing
by the way.</div>

Dearest Fanny, come to me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Take and eat my sweet grass here;</span><br />
Once you never us'd to flee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When with joy I did appear.</span><br />
<br />
But now, your lambkin by your side<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Takes all your thoughts and all your care;</span><br />
I may go, and run, and ride,<br />

<h2><i>No. 3.&mdash;Man and Ass.</i></h2>


<p>"Turnips, cabbages, carrots, Ho! Now
try, Ma'am; I dare say you and I can
agree upon a price for this bunch of turnips:
they were fresh gathered this morning,
I assure you; and I think if you buy
of me once, you will never buy of any body
else.&mdash;Pray, Ma'am, try my fine, fresh
codlins. They are very cheap, and as
large as you can get any where."</p>

<h2><i>No. 4.&mdash;Milk-maid and Cow.</i></h2>


<p>How quiet that cow seems, which Molly
the dairy-maid has just been milking. In
some parts of the world there are wild
cows, and buffaloes too, which will kill
those who attack them, if they can; but in
this happy island, there are no fierce wild
beasts, to frighten us from the fields by
day, or disturb our slumbers by night.</p>

<div class='poem'>
To Brighton or Worthing, and all with full speed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which way are you going so mightily fast?</span><br />
Take care of the reins, for your mettlesome steed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Might stumble and lay you too low at the last.</span><br />
<br />
With spurs and with boots you are finely set out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To take a long journey o'er hill and o'er dale;</span><br />
But remember one thing&mdash;'tis of mighty import&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your poney may founder, and all his strength fail.</span><br />
<br />
And you, too, confess, when you weary have been,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the end of your journey, wherever you roam;</span><br />
That, tho' houses, and parks, and fine rivers you've seen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's no place so happy, so sweet as your home.</span><br />

<h2><i>No. 6.&mdash;Man and Woman.</i></h2>


<p>Ah, poor people, how sorry I am for
you! I hope you have not far to go before
you see your nice little cottage. It is dismal
walking in such weather; but as you
are caught in the rain, you must make the
best of your way, and be thankful you
have a home to shelter you.</p>

<h2><i>No. 7.&mdash;The Gravel-pit.</i></h2>


<p>How industriously these men are working.
One is picking down the hard gravel,
with a pick-axe: the other is taking it up
with a shovel, and putting it into a sieve.
All the small pieces go through, and the
great stones remain. The sifted gravel, I
suppose, will be carried in a cart to some
gentleman's garden, to make walks; and the
stones will be used in mending the roads.</p>

</div>


<h2><i>No. 8.&mdash;Gardener.</i></h2>


<p>"May I dig a little for you, father? I
am sure I can dig very nicely, if you will
but let me try"&mdash;"And I can pull up the
weeds," said little Jane.&mdash;"You are both
mistaken," replied their father: "you,
John, have not strength to put the spade
far enough into the hard ground; and you,
Jane, would be apt to pull up flowers as
well as weeds: and so you must both be
satisfied to work in your own little gardens
for the present, till the one is stronger,
and the other wiser."</p>

<h2><i>No. 9.&mdash;The Well.</i></h2>


<p>The man who is drawing up water from
the well, appears to have rather hard work.
Wells are very useful things: in them is
collected a great quantity of water, which
can be drawn up by means of a rope and
bucket; and though it is some trouble to
do this, we must be willing to take it, for
the sake of getting such a useful, pleasant
thing as water.</p>

</div>

<h2><i>No. 10.&mdash;Little Girl and Ducks.</i></h2>


<p>"Oh you pretty little duck, how I
I should like to nurse you," said Amelia.
"That would be a great unkindness,"
replied her father: "the little duck is
fond of being in the water, and by the side
of its mother; and therefore it would be
quite unhappy in your warm hands. Little
ducks and chickens run to their mother
the moment they hear her call; and little
boys and girls should be obedient to their
kind parents, because they love them affectionately."</p>

<h2><i>No. 11.&mdash;Boys and Ass.</i></h2>


<p>I am glad to see these boys are not teasing
their ass, but, on the contrary, are taking
pleasure in putting a bough on its head,
to keep the flies off. Some boys are very
cruel to poor asses. The dog in this picture
seems to be rather angry at something,
but I cannot think at what; for these good
boys look as if they were kind to him, as
well as to their donkey.</p>

<h2><i>No. 12.&mdash;Children and Chaise.</i></h2>


<div class='poem'>
Oh! how delightful and charming<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To take the fresh air in a chaise;</span><br />
To gallop along without harming:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whip away! what a dust you do raise!</span><br />
<br />
Of trees and of ponds too beware;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mind likewise to treat well your ass;</span><br />
And then, with attention and care,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your time will in happiness pass.</span><br />

<h2><i>No. 13.&mdash;Chopping Wood.</i></h2>


<p>This man has in his hand a bill, and he
is probably going to cut up the tree for
fire-wood. The little girl seems to be
catching the chips, to carry home to her
mother. What a nice thing it is to see a
little girl employed in helping her father;
which, indeed, all little girls ought to endeavour
to do, because most parents do a
great deal for their children; and some have,
like this man, to work <em>very hard for them</em>.</p>

</div>


<h2><i>No. 14.&mdash;Harvest Field.</i></h2>


<p>Oh! what a delightful sight is the harvest-field.
Our great Creator has made the
corn grow, to make nice food for the use of
man. One of these men is cutting down the
corn, and the other is binding it up into a
sheaf; whilst those at a distance are carrying
a waggon-full home, to put into the barn.
They have got a little cask of beer, which
is a necessary refreshment, after having
worked hard in the hot sun.</p>

<h2><i>No. 15.&mdash;Blind Man.</i></h2>


<div class='poem'>
To kindest pity now inclin'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">See these children wish to give</span><br />
A trifle to the poor and blind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus assisting him to live.</span><br />
<br />
See, all ragged and forlorn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He is resting by a tree;</span><br />
And to him the light of morn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shades of eve alike must be.</span><br />
<br />
Kind pity then, thou blessed gift,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Help and relieve the sore distress'd;</span><br />
And up to heav'n his heart he'll lift,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That you with mercy may be blest.</span><br />

</div>



<h2><i>No. 16.&mdash;Man sowing Corn.</i></h2>


<p>This man is sowing seed, perhaps wheat
or oats. The ground has been prepared by
ploughing and harrowing. That box holds
the seed. After the field is sown, a boy will
be set to keep off the birds, which would
otherwise come and eat up a great deal of it.</p>

<h2><i>No. 17.&mdash;The Shepherd.</i></h2>


<p>"Remark," said a fond mother to her
little girl, whilst admiring a fine flock of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a><br /><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a><br /><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
sheep feeding in a green meadow, "how
good our Heavenly Father is to all his creatures.
He makes the grass, to serve the
sheep for a soft couch to lie down upon
when they are tired, and to afford them a
pleasant meal when they are hungry."</p>

</div>


<h2><i>No. 18.&mdash;Mother and Children.</i></h2>


<p>Some people are rich, and have plenty
of every thing they wish for; whilst others
are poor, and are obliged to be contented
with few things. The rich farmer gives his
poor neighbours leave to pick up the ears
of corn that are scattered about, to make
them a few loaves in the winter. See that
cottager, with a load upon her head: her
eldest girl is helping her; and a chubby
little boy trudges joyfully by her side.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 78px;">
<img src="images/divider_2.png" width="78" height="14" alt="divider" />
</div>
<h2><i>No. 19.&mdash;Errand Cart.</i></h2>


<p>If you have any parcels to send, good
people, pray make haste and overtake this
man, who is called an errand-man. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
makes it his business to carry parcels, for
which you must pay him a small sum.
His dog probably guards his parcels, when
he has occasion to stop at a house and
leave his cart.</p>

</div>

<h2><i>No. 20.&mdash;Mill.</i></h2>


<p>Within this mill are two very large stones:
one of them is kept quite quiet, whilst the
other is moved round; and the corn being
put between them, is ground to a powder.
Afterwards, all the coarse parts of the husk
are taken away by means of sifting: this
coarse part is called bran; and the fine
white inside is flour, of which bread is
made.</p>





<h2><i>No. 21.&mdash;Dobbin.</i></h2>


<p>"Whoa, Dobbin!" says a man to his
horse: "if you go further into the pond, I
shall have to follow you, which I shall not
like, with my shoes and stockings on." The
other horse is drinking very quietly. What
a pleasant thing to have a nice pond to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a><br /><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a><br /><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to when they are thirsty; and I hope the
men also have got a nice supper at home,
and kind wives and children to welcome
their return.</p>

<h2><i>No. 22.&mdash;Child and Chickens.</i></h2>


<p>"Chick, chick, chick, here is some corn
for you, and crumbs of bread and cheese,
which mamma saved for you after dinner.
Now mind, you little things, don't quarrel
about the pieces: if you do, I won't give
you any more."</p>

<h2><i>No. 23.&mdash;Rabbit, Goat, and Hare.</i></h2>


<p>Here are three very pretty animals. The
first is a rabbit, of a kind, gentle disposition.
The second is a goat: he is by nature
wild, and jumps about from crag to crag,
on his native mountains. The third is the
timid hare. I am afraid she is running from
the pursuit of the dog. Ah! what a cruel
thing it is to set dogs to hunt this beautiful
little animal.</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
